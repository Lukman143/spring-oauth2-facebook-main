To add a domain and its sub-domains to the "App Domains" field in your Facebook app settings, you can follow these steps:

    Go to the Facebook Developers website and log in to your account.
    Select the app that you want to edit the settings for.
    Click on the "Settings" tab in the left sidebar.
    Under the "Basic" settings section, scroll down to the "App Domains" field and enter the domain and all its sub-domains that you want to add.
    Click the "Add Platform" button, select "Website", and enter your website's URL in the "Site URL" field.
    Save your changes by clicking the "Save Changes" button.

Once you have completed these steps, Facebook should be able to recognize the URL and load it properly without showing the warning message.
